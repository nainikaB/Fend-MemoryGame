# Fend-MemoryGame

# About the project 
The project is about a Memory Game that was one of our Udacity projects, it was part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

# Project Instructions 
We were provided with a starter code on top of which we had to build an engaging project.
We were supposed to modify the HTML and CSS files, but mostly the JavaScript file.

# The rules of the game 
The game consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck contains eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged in a random way on the grid with all the symbols facing down.

Each turn:

The player flips one card over and the card turns the other side.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay the same side since they have found their match.
If the cards do not match, both cards are remain face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched and flipped over.
